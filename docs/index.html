					<p>Yelp is a local-search service powered by crowd-sourced review forum, as well as an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California. It develops, hosts and markets Yelp.com and the Yelp mobile app, which publish crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses. In this project using the Yelp Fusion v3 API, we analyze and search for trends amoung cities. The dataset used is a collection of results of the first 500 businesses that best match the search mirror exactly what happens with their mobile and web services.</p>
